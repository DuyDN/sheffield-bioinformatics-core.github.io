## Overview

In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analysing and sharing data. 

This workshop is designed to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data, using a combination of tools with a main focus in R. The workshop is aimed at researchers in the life sciences at all career stages and is designed for learners with little to no prior knowledge of programming, shell scripting, or command line tools


## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

 
- "Clean" a spreadsheet so that it is ready for analysis in R
- Create a *reproducible* piece of R code to import and visualise data
