## Overview

High-throughput genomic data analysis is now a defining skill in the life sciences. There is already a shortage of researchers who can bridge the gap between computational approaches to data and biological insights, and this demand is only getting stronger. Bioinformatics training is under-provisioning in the North of England, with many small Bioinformatics teams at different institutes lacking the resources to deliver a full Bioinformatics training programme.

The aims of this workshop are to understand similarities in current bioinformatics education across the region, standardise learning outcomes, and to share teaching load

Attendance of the workshop is **free**, and we can offer 1 nights accomodation for a small number of people. Please indicate if you would to be considered for free accomodation. ***Preference will be given to those currently engaged in Bioinformatics training, and to ensure equal representation of Institutes in the North of England.***
