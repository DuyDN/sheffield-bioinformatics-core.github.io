description: "This course covers state-of-the-art and best-practice tools for the analysis of genomes. We describe, and give hands-on experience of, the entire analysis workflow from raw data generated by a sequencing machine to deriving variant calls (e.g. Single Nucleotide Variants) that are ready for downstream analysis, interpretation and prioritisation. We will describe the steps involved to go from sequencing library to a prioritised, clinically-relevant list of DNA variants. Practical sessions will use the user-friendly Galaxy interface (https://usegalaxy.org/) to demonstrate tasks such as alignment, quality control, variant-calling and annotation."

## Overview



## Who should attend this course?

Healthcare providers and researchers who want to get an appreciation for how variants are identified and interpreted, but not neccesarily working on this problem routinely. 

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:


## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:


## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required. Prior knowledge of NGS sequencing technologies would be an advantage, but not required.

## Instructors

- Dr Matthew Parker, Clinical Bioinformatics Core Scientist
- Dr Mark Dunning, Bioinformatics Core Director
- Dr Dennis Wang, Lecturer in Genomic Medicine

## Timetable (provisional)
