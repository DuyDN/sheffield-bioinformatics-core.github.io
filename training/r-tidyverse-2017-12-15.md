## Overview

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. In this course we introduce some relatively-new additions to the R programming language; dplyr and ggplot2. In combination these provide a powerful toolkit to make the process of manipulating and visualising data easy and intuitive. 

## Who should attend this course?

Researchers in life sciences who want to get started using R for their data analysis

## Aims:- After this course you should be able to:

- Import tidy datasets into R and perform some basic data cleaning
- Use dplyr to explore a dataset interactively
- Produce simple analysis workflows in R
- Make publication-ready graphics using ggplot2

## Objectives:- During this course you will learn about:

- What constitues a tidy dataset
- Subseting and filtering datasets using dplyr
- *Piping* commands together to form a workflow
- Producing summary statistics from a dataset
- Joining datasets using dplyr
- The grammar of graphics approach to plotting used in ggplot2
- Producing publication-ready graphics using ggplot2


## Prerequisites

We will assume that you have basic familarity with R and are familiar with vectors, data frames, variables and using functions.


## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of *both* R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
