There are many problems that plague medicine and healthcare. It is a wonder why these problems still exist, given how crucial health is to everyone here on Earth.

What better way to accelerate the solving of these problems by integrating technology into our radical solutions, while providing a safe, creative environment for people to do so?

HackMed aims to bring together hackers, dreamers, and doers to solve problems related to humanityâ€™s elementary need, health.
