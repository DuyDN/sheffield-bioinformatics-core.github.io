## Abstract

> With recent technological developments it has become possible to characterize a single cell’s genome, epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. However, to take advantage of such data it is critical that appropriate computational methods are applied and developed. In this presentation, I will describe some of the computational challenges and the solutions we have developed, focusing particularly on applications in the context of cell fate decisions in early mammalian development.

## Biography

Dr John Marioni

Research Group Leader 

European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)

John Marioni is a Research Group Leader at the [EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/marioni), a Senior Group Leader at the [CRUK Cambridge Institute](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/marioni-group) within the University of Cambridge and an [Associate Faculty member](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/marioni-john) of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

John read for his PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Professor Simon Tavaré](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/st321/CRUK_CI.html) before becoming a postdoctoral scholar under the supervision of [Professor Matthew Stephens](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/matthew-stephens/) at the University of Chicago. John’s lab has pioneered the development of methods for the analysis of single-cell genomics data. Subsequently, his lab has applied them, in conjunction with outstanding experimental collaborators, to understand cell fate decisions in early mammalian development.
