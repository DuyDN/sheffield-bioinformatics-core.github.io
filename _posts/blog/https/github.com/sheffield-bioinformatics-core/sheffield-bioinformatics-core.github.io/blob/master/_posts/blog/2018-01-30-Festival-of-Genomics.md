Our Core Associate Scientific Director, Dr. Dennis Wang, is chairing a session at the Festival of Genomics being held in January 30-31st in London.


The [Festival of Genomics](http://www.festivalofgenomicslondon.com) is a three day conference and exhibition for anyone generating, using, or studying genomic information. 
In 2018 there will be discussions on : Cancer genomics, cardiovascular health, clinical genomics, CRISPR, drug development, enabling data, genetic counselling, immuno-oncology, implementation of genomics in the clinic, infectious diseases, patient engagement and much more.

Dennis will be chairing a session entitled [Best practices for predictive genomic diagnostics and how to assess their performance](http://www.festivalofgenomicslondon.com/speakers/dennis-wang) on the afternoon of the 31st January. Topics include:
* Discover ways to assess the performance of diagnostic tests
* Explore the data and algorithmic challenges of integrating various genomic features to make a diagnosis, and how do we regulate this process
