## Fees

The SBC charge an hourly-rate of ***£66*** for internal clients, and ***£74*** per-hour for external clients. We will provide you with an estimate of the number of hours required, a quote and a start date as part of our Memorandum of Understanding. During the project you will receive detailed monthly billing updates and ongoing analysis results via our project page. 

Please note that payment of fees for data analysis services and authorship are not mutually exclusive. Depending on their contributions to a project, SBC data analysts might be considered collaborators at the same level as other academic colleagues who contribute intellectually and receive funding for work on a project. The recovery of Core expenses through the recharge system does not exclude the possibility for authorship for Core personnel. Similarly, authorship does not substitute for payment of Core expenses for services rendered. 

## Publications

The SBC does not require or request co-authorship on studies using data generated solely by using off-the-shelf software on a fee-for-service basis by our facilities. However, in cases where significant intellectual contributions are made by SBC members, co-authorship follows commonly-accepted scientific practice.

In order to monitor our support service and satisfy institutional reporting requirements, we require clients acknowledge work performed by SBC in peer-reviewed publications in either one of the following two ways:

• in the acknowledgement section by stating that *"The authors would like to thank [Name of Consultant] of the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, The University of Sheffield for assistance with [services performed],"* or

• in the appropriate body text section for which SBC provided a service by stating that *"[Service] was provided by the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, The University of Sheffield."*
